This applet is a dual Schmitt Trigger with a programmable threshold range.

Controls
* CV Inputs: Input for each channel
* Outputs: Gate signal for each channel
* Encoder push: Alternates between Low threshold, High threshold, and locked
* Encoder turn: Set Low and High thresholds

A Schmitt Trigger is a type of comparator that provides hysteresis in a modular patch. Each Schmitt Trigger's output goes high when its input crosses the High threshold (default of 2.6V), and stays high until the input goes back below the Low threshold (default of 2.1V).

Schmitt Trigger is in Hemisphere Suite from v1.4.
