#triggerGenerator #gate #probability #dualOutput #singleInput

*Brancher* is a Bernoulli Gate, inspired by Mutable Instruments Branches. It sends incoming gate or clock to one of two outputs, based on a selected probability.

### I/O

|                |                1/3                 |    2/4     |
| -------------- | :--------------------------------: | :--------: |
| Trig (Digital) | Signal (clock or gate) for routing | No effect  |
| CV In          |  Probability modulation (bipolar)  | No effect  |
| Output         |             Output A/C             | Output B/D |

### UI Parameters
* Probability
* Press encoder to override probability-selected output and switch to the other one
