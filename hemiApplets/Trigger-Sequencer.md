Trigger Sequencer is a dual eight-step trigger sequencer.

Controls
* Digital Ins: A clock at Digital 1 advances both sequences. A trigger at Digital 2 resets both sequences to the top.
* CV Ins: While a gate is present at CV 1, the A/C and B/D outputs are swapped
* Outputs: A/C is Channel 1's trigger output, and B/D is Channel 2's trigger output
* Encoder Push: Cycles cursor between editing first and second half of Channel 1, length of Channel 1, first and second half of Channel 2, and length of Channel 2.
* Encoder Turn: Adjust the selected setting

The cursor appears over four steps at a time. Turning the encoder selects a binary representation of the bit pattern. Each half of the sequence has sixteen possible values. That is, turning the encoder clockwise will cycle through
