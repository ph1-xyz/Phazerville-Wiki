#dualInput #dualOutput 

Gate Delay is a dual trigger/gate delay loosely based on the Ladik S-189.

Controls
* Digital Ins: Clock/Trigger input per channel
* CV Ins: Bi-polar time modulation per channel
* Outputs: Delayed clock/trigger output
* Encoder Push: Move cursor between channels
* Encoder Turn: Set delay time, from 0ms to 2000ms

Gate Delay has a 1ms resolution and a 2 second recording time. Modulation is bi-polar and can change the time by up to 1000ms.
