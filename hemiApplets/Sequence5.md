Sequence5 is a five-step quantized sequencer.

Contols
* Digital Ins: A clock at Digital 1 advances the sequencer, and a clock at Digital 2 resets to the first step
* CV Ins: (As of Hemisphere 1.3) CV 1 is a bi-polar transposition control over a two-octave range from -12 to +12 semitones, with CV between -2.5V and +2.5V
* Outputs: A/C is the quantized CV. B/D sends a trigger when the sequencer gets back to the first step.
* Encoder Push: Moves the cursor through the note sliders
* Encoder Turn: Selects the note or mutes the step

Each step is a semitone increment over a 2.5 octave (32-note) range. To change the length of the sequence, you can mute one or more steps by moving the slider all the way down until the slider handle disappears. The clock will skip muted steps.
