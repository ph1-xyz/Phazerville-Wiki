*Binary Counter* is weird. It takes four logic inputs (high or low) and provides a binary-summed output and a count output.

### I/O

|                |              1/3      |    2/4          |
| -------------- |:---------------------:|:---------------:|
| Trig (Digital) |  Bit 3                | Bit 2           |
| CV In          |  Bit 1                | Bit 0           |
| Output         |  Binary sum of inputs | Count of inputs |

**Binary Sum (Outputs A/C)**: each bit contributes a value based on its bit number. Approximate voltages are as follows:
* Bit 0 contributes .33V
* Bit 1 contributes .67V
* Bit 2 contributes 1.33V
* Bit 3 contributes 2.67V

**Count (Output B/D)**: Each bit contributes the same value (approximately 1.25V).

### UI Parameters
* None
