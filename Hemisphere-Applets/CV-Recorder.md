**Recording**
To start recording, choose a length by setting the Start and End points. Advance the cursor down to the transport control (which will usually just say "Play"). Turn the encoder to choose which track or tracks you wish to record (1, 2, 1+2). When you press the encoder button, recording will begin. An indicator bar will display on top of the transport control line to indicate remaining steps. Recording will automatically stop once the end point step has been reached, and looping play mode will resume.
