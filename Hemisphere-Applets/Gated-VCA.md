#dualInput #dualOutput #VCA

Gated VCA is a VCA for CV, with the ability to gate the first output. It can sort of be used for audio, but works best as an extra CV VCA.

Controls
* Digital Ins: Digital 1 gates Output A, Digital 2 reverse-gates Output B
* CV Ins: Input 1 is the CV signal and Input 2 is the CV amount
* Outputs: A/C is silent until Digital In 1 is gated, and B/D is on until Digital 2 is gated
* Encoder Turn: Increase and decrease CV Offset

This works like a fairly simple VCA, with the ability to suppress one of the outputs completely, regardless of the CV amount.
