Switch is a two-channel switch with two switching methods: sequential and gated.

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   |     |     |
| CV INs |     |     |
| OUTs   |     |     |


Controls
* Digital Ins: A clock at Digital 1 switches the A/C output between Signal 1 and Signal 2. A gate at Digital 2 switches the B/D output to Signal 2 .
* CV Ins: CV 1 is Signal 1, and CV 2 is Signal 2
* Outputs: A/C is the sequentially-selected output, and B/D is the gated output. The sequential output alternates between Signal 1 and Signal 2, and the gated output sends Signal 1 when digital Digital 2 is low, and Signal 2 when high.

Switch uses a Skyline display to indicate status of each channel. The indicator for each channel also specifies whether Signal 1 or Signal 2 is currently selected.

**Note**: _The Ornament and Crime's circuitry is not made for precision 1:1 reproduction of voltages. The outputs will not exactly match the inputs, so Switch is not suitable for pitch CV. This is inherent to the O_C's design and does not indicate poor calibration._
