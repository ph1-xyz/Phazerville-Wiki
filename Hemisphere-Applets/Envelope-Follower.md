#audioInput #envelopeGenerator 

EnvFollow is an envelope follower and ducker.

Controls
* CV Inputs: Signal inputs for channels 1 and 2
* Outputs: Output 1's output increases as the amplitude of Input 1 increases. Output 2's output decreases as the amplitude of Input 2 increases.
* Encoder: Gain per channel

Since audio signals are typically much lower than the typical CV range, a gain of up to 31x is provided.

EnvFollow is in Hemisphere Suite starting at v1.4.
