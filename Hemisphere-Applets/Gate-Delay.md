#dualInput #dualOutput 

Gate Delay is a dual trigger/gate delay loosely based on the Ladik S-189.

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   |     |     |
| CV INs |     |     |
| OUTs   |     |     |


Controls
* Digital Ins: Clock/Trigger input per channel
* CV Ins: Bi-polar time modulation per channel
* Outputs: Delayed clock/trigger output
* Encoder Push: Move cursor between channels
* Encoder Turn: Set delay time, from 0ms to 2000ms

Gate Delay has a 1ms resolution and a 2 second recording time. Modulation is bi-polar and can change the time by up to 1000ms.
