Bug Crack is a hi-fi replacement for BootsNCats. It has a nice and boomy kick, as well as a versatile snare/percussion channel. The snare is inspired by the FM drum voice in [Peaks](https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/peaks/), by Mutable Instruments, and can blend between a sine wave oscillator and noise source.

### UI Parameters
* Kick tone (frequency)
* Kick decay
* Kick punch
* Kick drop
* CV1 (Kick) assignment (attenuation, tone, decay, FM, drop)
* Snare tone (frequency)
* Snare decay
* Snare snap
* Snare blend
* CV2 (Snare) assignment (attenuation, tone, decay, FM, blend)

**Frequency (ton) - Kick and Snare**
The base frequency of the drum. Kick has a range of 30-60Hz, snare has a range of 100-700Hz.

**Decay (dec) - Kick and Snare**
The time in takes for the sounds to fade out. On the snare, this parameter also affects the Snap time.

**Punch (FM) - Kick**
Punch causes a quick pitch drop at the beginning of the sound that's common in kick drums. Punch controls how high up the pitch drop starts from.

**Drop (dro) - Kick**
Drop controls the time it takes to get from the Punch value to the Frequency value.

**Snap (FM) - Snare**
Snap is equivalent to the Punch parameter. It causes a pitch drop at the beginning of the sound, at the higher frequencies of the snare range it can create a nice snapping sound.

**Blend (bln) - Snare**
Blend between the oscillator and noise.

**CV Assignment**
In addition to all of the parameters above, the CV inputs can also be assigned to attenuation (atn). A positive voltage increases the attenuation, meaning it gets more quiet. This is opposite to what a "volume" parameter would do, but is required due to constraints of the o_C.
