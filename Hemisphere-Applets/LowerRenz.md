#generator/LFO #CH2/gate/hold 

LowerRenz is a single Lorenz-only modulation generator based on the O_C's own Low-Rentz Dual Lorenz/RÃ¶ssler Generator, which is itself based on an Easter Egg from Mutable Instruments Streams.

Controls
* Digital Ins: A trigger at Digital 1 resets the generator, and a gate at Digital 2 freezes the outputs until the gate goes low.
* CV Ins: CV 1 is bi-polar modulation for Frequency, and CV 2 is bi-polar modulation for Rho, whatever Rho is
* Outputs: A/C is the Lorenz X value, and B/D is the Y value
* Encoder Push: Alternates the cursor between Frequency and Rho, whatever Rho is
* Encoder Turn: Sets the value at the cursor, either Frequency or Rho. Whatever Rho is.
