Skewed LFO is a low frequency oscillator with a waveshape that's adjustable from sawtooth, to triangle, to ramp.

Controls
* Digital Ins: A clock at Digital 1 resets the LFO
* CV Ins: CV 1 modifies the rate, and CV 2 modifies the skew
* Outputs: A/C is the bi-polar CV output, and B/D sends an end-of cycle trigger
* Encoder Push: Alternates cursor between setting rate and skew
* Encoder Turn: Adjusts the selected setting

Note the the CV inputs _modify_ the settings with bi-polar CV input between about -2.5 volts and about 2.5 volts. There is a small center detent in the middle of the range in which no modification is made.
