Tuner is a chromatic tuner with adjustable A4 setting.

_Important: Tuner can only run in the right hemisphere. It will remind you if you try to place it in the left. This is because technical reasons beyond my control._

Controls
* Digital Inputs: Digital 2 is the oscillator input
* Encoder: Set A4 frequency
* Encoder push: Reset tuner

The A4 frequency has a range of 400-500Hz. The closest note is displayed under the frequency. Under that, it shows how far off from that note in cents the input is. When the note is in tune, it will become highlighted.

If Tuner seems to stop responding, push the encoder button to reset it.

Yeah, that's about it. It's a tuner.

Tuner is available from Hemisphere Suite v1.4.
