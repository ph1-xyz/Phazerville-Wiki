### Quad Performance Quantizer + Pitch Fine-Tuning App
Based on a design spec from Chris Meyer ([Alias Zone](https://aliaszone.com/) / [Learning Modular](https://learningmodular.com/)) - this is a **4-channel Pitch CV fine-tuning tool** with performance-oriented transpose controls. Each channel can be clocked for S&H of the Transposition or the Input as well. There are 4 preset banks to store and quickly switch configurations.

There's a mini applet version called _Calibr8_. Paired with the Tuner applet, this is can be handy for examining the pitch-tracking of your oscillators! Accurate performance will depend on the calibration of your o_C module itself.

### Calibr8or Controls:
- UP / DOWN buttons - switch channels
- Long-press Left Encoder - cycle Clocked Transpose / S&H modes per channel
- Quick-press Left Encoder - switch between Transpose and Fine-Tune controls
- Quick-press Right Encoder - toggle Scale & Root Note selection
- Long-press DOWN button - preset switching
