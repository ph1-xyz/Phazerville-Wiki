_Meta-Q_ is a quantiser that is basically similar to [[_Quantermain_]], except it has only two channels.

It has fewer internal CV sources (currently, only LFSR. See _[[Copiermaschine]]_/_[[Quantermain]]_ for details), but comes with four ‘scale slots’ per channel — a package of scale, mask, root and transpose values —, which themselves can be **sequenced** to provide a lot of additional, structured variation to the input CV sequences (or the LFSR internal CV source).

### Description
#### Scale Editor
- works **mostly** the same (as in the other quantising modes). Notably, the `up` and `down` buttons behave slighlty differently, however: pushing `up` will point the editor to the next scale-slot, pushing `down` will point it to the previous scale-slot. This way, you can edit all the scale-slots more easily from within the editor.
    
- In the editor, you can also change the scale-type, root, and transpose settings: to do so, **hold** the `up` button (= ‘shift’) while turning the **left** encoder: that’ll change the scale, just like in the regular menu. to edit the root and transpose values, **hold** the `up` button, then push the left encoder (= ‘shift’ + push left): that’ll open a new window, displaying the slot’s root and transpose values. you can select which parameter to edit by using the left encoder; adjust the value by turning the right encoder; or use the up / down buttons to advance to a different slot. push the left encoder again to return to the basic scale editor.

#### Slots in Scale Editor
- Each scale ‘slot’ (= `scale #`) can be mapped to any of the available preset and user scales and/or scale masks (via the main menu or scale editor). The scale slots can also be assigned their own root and transpose settings.
    
- The scale editor in _Meta-Q_ thus is slightly more complex than in the other modes: it allows you to edit the four scales-slots (not just one scale) from within the editor, ie both scale as well as the root and transpose values. In basic use, it works much the same as in _Quantermain_ or _Copiermaschine_; notably, the `up` button behaves slighlty differently, however: in the _Meta-Q_ scale editor it assumes a ‘shift’ functionality to access the (slot-specific) root and (diatonic) transpose settings (details see below).
#### Sequencer Mode
- What is more, said four scale-slots can be sequenced (or just toggled) by using a clock signal and/or by modulating the slot-parameter with a control voltage:
    
    - Use the auxiliary trigger inputs **TR2** resp. **TR4** to cycle through either 2, 3, or 4 _adjacent_ scale slots: see the `seq mode` setting. Available settings are **TR+1** (= plus next scale), **TR+2** (= plus next two scales), **TR+3** (= plus next three scales). Things wrap around slot #4. Thus, for example, when selecting `scale #` = 3 and `seq mode` = TR+2 (= scale #3 plus next two scales), when clocked via the aux. trigger input, the scale slots will step through the following sequence: #3, #4, #1, #3, #4, #1, #3, #4, #1, #3, #4, #1, #3 …
        
    - Setting the `CV aux.` parameter to `scl#` (= scale #) allows modulation of the slot-parameter with a CV signal applied to CV2 (channel #1) or CV4 (channel #2). (Alternatively, **CV aux.** can be routed to root, mask (= scale mask), trns (= transpose/scale degrees), or oct (transpose/octaves)).
        
    - **NB**: inputs TR2 and CV2 are hardcoded to service channel #1, TR4 and CV4 to service channel #2.
### aux-outputs-C-D

- when `trigger source` = TR1 - TR4, the **aux. outputs** (C, D) simply pass through the main trigger signal, with adjustable pulse-width (`--> pw`); when set to continuous (`cnt`), the aux. output goes high if/when the note **changes** (= trigger-on-note-change).
    
- the aux. outputs can alternatively output a transposed copy of the main channel CV (aux.output = `copy`), or output said CV, delayed by one clock (aux.output = `asr`).
    

### Available settings (per-channel)

|Setting|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`scale`|selected scale|
|`--> edit`|edit scale mask (for details see _Quantermain_ and below)|
|`seq mode`|number of slots (-, 2, 3, or 4) to advance scale sequencer before reset (via `TR2` resp. `TR4`)|
|`scale #`|selected scale slot (`#1` - `#4`)|
|`root #n`|root note for scale slot n|
|`transpose #n`|offset (in scale degrees) for scale slot n|
|`octave`|offset in octaves (for all scale slots)|
|`CV source`|sample input, internal/external (`CV1` - `CV4`, `LFSR`)|
|`CV aux.`|auxiliary CV input destination: `scale #`, `root`, `transpose`, `octave`, `mask`|
|`trigger source`|main trigger source: `TR1` - `TR4` , `cnt+`, `cnt-` (†)|
|`--> latency`|trigger-to-quantization latency (default: `0` = 60 us). Note: this is equivalent to the `Trigger delay` setting in several of the other apps, please see the _Quantermain_ app documentation for a discussion of this setting.|
|`aux.output`|aux channel output: `gate`, `copy`, `asr` (††)|
|`--> pw`|pulse-width of triggers at C/D outputs (`gate` mode)|
|`--> aux +/-`|pitch offset at C/D outputs (in octaves) (`copy` and `asr` modes)|
|`> LFSR length`|length of shift register (when in LFSR mode)|
|`> LFSR p`|probability of flipping (when in LFSR mode)|
|`> LFSR range`|output range (when in LFSR mode)|
|`> LFSR CV`|destination of `CV1` resp. `CV3` (when in LFSR mode)|
|`> LFSR TRIG`|aux channel output (when in LFSR mode): `echo`, `lsb`, `chng`: clock through, track LSB, and output on note-change|

- notes:
    - (†) `cnt+` and `cnt-`= continuous quantization; in this case, a gate applied to `TR1` resp. `TR3` will shift the pitch up (`cnt+`) or down (`cnt-`) by one octave.
    - (††) `copy` simply duplicates the main channel output to the aux channel output. `asr` does the same, but delayed by one clock.
