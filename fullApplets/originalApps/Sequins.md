#sequencer #CVgenerator 

_Sequins_ is a basic, **dual-channel sequencer**.

The app provides four 16-step sequences per channel and CV-control over various channel parameters, including scale mask, octave, pulsewidth, clock multiplication and division. The four sequences can be **chained** in various ways, providing sequences from **4 to up to 64 notes**. The sequence data is stored along with the other settings (whenever settings are saved).

### Description
- the **sequence editor** works similarly to the scale editor in the quantizer modes:
    - in the main menu, select which sequence to edit by adjusting the `sequence #` parameter.
    - then right-click on the item displayed right below (`--> edit`) to **open the sequence-editor**.
    - **mute/unmute** notes by clicking the left encoder: the step value is displayed in a format x+y.yy, where x is the octave (above or below 0.00V) and y.yy gives the semitone offset. for instance `+2+2.23` = 2.23 semitones above octave #2 (=~ 2.000V).
    - adjust the sequence **length** by pointing the cursor to the far right, then turn the right encoder.
    - (**simultaneously** push down the _left_ encoder to also **mute/clear** the steps that are being added while expanding the sequence).
    - to adjust the **pitch**, simply move the cursor to a given slot, then turn the right encoder: this will increase or decrease the pitch in **semitones** (= step size: `1.00`). note these values are **pre-quantization**, so the effect this has will depend on the chosen scale.
    - to **fine-tune** the pitch (= step size: ~ `0.01`), hold down the left encoder **while** turning the right encoder.
    - **note**: the number displayed when adjusting the note values is the actual (pre-quantization) DAC code (that’s far from ideal, i know …). details on what those numbers mean can be found [here](https://ornament-and-cri.me/custom-scales/).
    - in the sequence-editor, you can use the **up/down** buttons to select which sequence to edit (`#1` - `#4`). (this makes it possible to edit sequences ‘offline’, ie make adjustments to, say, sequence #2 while sequence #1 is playing).
    - **copy+paste**: in the sequence-editor, long-press the left encoder to **copy** the selected sequence. select a different sequence slot, then long-press the down button to **paste** it into that slot. copy+paste works across channels. (note: once copied (or pasted), sequence data will be stored in a temporary buffer for about 15 seconds, after which it’ll expire.)
- the `playmode` and `direction` settings offer various ways of moving through the sequence(s):
    - `-` (default): advance by trigger, using the chosen sequence and direction settings.
    - `SEQ+1 - SEQ+3`: ditto, but **cycling** through 2, 3, or 4 adjacent sequences (= allows up to 64 notes).
    - `TR+1 - TR+3`: ditto, but **jumps** to the next sequence only _if/when_ a trigger is received at the **aux.** trigger inputs.
    - `ARP`: **arpeggiate** the sequence.
    - `S+H#1 - S+H#4`: CV-address, when triggered (**sample and hold**).
    - `CV#1 - CV#4`: CV-address, **free-running**.
- note: when in CV-address mode, the `CV adr. range` setting adjusts the resolution of the chosen input (CV1-CV4), relative to the length of the sequence (ie, you’ll either need `5V` or `10V` to move through the entire span of the sequence).
    
- the secondary/aux. clock inputs (TR2, TR4) can be used to either **cycle** through the sequences (see above), or they can be selected as a **reset/mute** signal (`reset/mute`). the options are: `RST2`, `RST4` (reset) and `=HI2`, `=LO2`, `=HI4`, and `=LO4` (mute when aux. clock goes high, respectively low.). NB: When using a clock divider or the like (or anything that will introduce latency relative to the main clock inputs TR1/TR3), it can/will make sense to increase the trigger-to-processing latency (see the `Trigger delay` setting). This will make sure the auxiliary trigger (or control voltage) is processed within the current update window. (Also see _Quantermain_ above for an extended discussion of the trigger delay setting).


### Available settings (per-channel)

|`--> att shape`|(if `aux. mode`=`AD`, `ADR` or `ADSR`) shape of the attack segment of the envelope output on the auxiliary channels (C or D outputs). See the _Piqued_ app for details of envelope segment shapes.|
|`--> dec dur`|(if `aux. mode`=`AD`, `ADR` or `ADSR`) duration of the decay segment of the envelope output on the auxiliary channels (C or D outputs)|

|`--> sus level`|(if `aux. mode`=`ADR` or `ADSR`) level of the sustain segment of the envelope output (for `ADSR` envelopes), or the level at which the the decay segment transitions into the release segment (for `ADR` envelopes) on the auxiliary channels (C or D outputs).|

|`reset/mute`|select reset/mute source (mute being more like ‘pause’)|
|`clock src`|choose channel clock source (`TR1` or `TR3`)|
|`trigger delay`|trigger-to-processing latency (accessed via CV menu): details see _Quantermain_ above|

**Note**: There is a bug in the v1.3.3 firmware which prevents the gate auxiliary output from working unless the `mult/div` for that channel is set to `x2` or above. This bug was fixed in v1.3.3b firmware.

### CV menu
- **enter** the CV menu by pushing the down button:
    - use the right encoder to assign CV input channels 1-4 to a channel parameter (currently available parameters are: `transposition` (in octaves), `scale mask`, `sequence number` (1-4), `sequence length`, `direction`, `multiplier/divisor` and `pulsewidth`. The quantiser/sampling `trigger delay` (see notes for `Trigger delay` in _Quantermain_) and the `clock src` (clock source) can also be specified in this sub-menu, as well as CV input mappings to these envelope parameters: `att dur`, `dec dur`, `sus lvl`, `rel dur` and `env loops`. By using CV to control `env loops`, a sort of psuedo-ratchetting effect can be obtained. Other envelope behaviours can also be specified (see the _Piqued_ app for details): `att rest`, `att fall gt` and `dec/rel reset`.
    - **return** to the main menu by either pressing the **up** or **down** buttons, or by moving the cursor to an empty field and then pressing the right encoder button.
    - **clear** all mappings (per channel) by long-pressing the down button (in CV menu)
