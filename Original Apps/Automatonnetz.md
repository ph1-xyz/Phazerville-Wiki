The *Automatonnetz*, coded up by Patrick Dowling, combines the neo-Riemannian triad chord transformations of *Harrington 1200*, also running in the Ornament & Crime module, inspired by Noise Engineering Tonnetz Sequent module, combined with the *Exfilnator* vector sequencer idea expressed by fcd72 (Frank) of d:Machinery.

Neo-Riemannian transformations are applied to sequences determined by the "navigation" of a 5x5 grid of cells.

### Description

On each clock input the `dx` (delta x) and `dy` (delta y) values are added to the current position on the grid to determine the next cell. The position simply wraps around when it reaches the edge of the grid, and "backwards" motion is also possible. The position and movement can also be fractional, allowing for clock divisions and all kinds of patterns.

Each cell of the grid can contain a neo-Riemannian transformation, or a reset, as well as other parameters. In this app, there are three additional transforms available, which can be represented as a combination of the basic three neo-Riemannian transforms:

- **S** (*Slide*): *LPR*
	- example S(Cmaj) = C#min
- **H** (*Hexatonic*): *LPL*
	- example H(Cmaj) = A-min
- **N** (*Nebenverwandt*): *RLP*
	- example N(Cmaj) = Fmin

The implementation computes these in a single transform step however, not sequentially.


### Grid settings

| Setting | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dx`    | Amount of movement along x-axis (horizontal) per clock input|
|`dy` | Amount of movement along y-axis (vertical) per clock input|
|`Mode` | Musicological mode of root triad, either `maj` or `min` |
|`Oct` | Move outputs up/down in octave steps
|`OutA` | Switch output mode of channel A: `root` outputs root note, `trig` outputs a trigger whenever the triad output on B, C and D is transformed, `arp` arpeggiates the current triad, `strm` (strum) arpeggiates the triad once only as soon as the triad transformation has taken place (tip: very useful with the Mutable Instruments Elements or Rings modules, or Mutable Instruments Braids in "PLUK" mode)
|`Clr` | Sets how the grid is cleared on a long-press of the left encoder. `zero` clears the grid, `rT` fills with random transforms, `rTev` sets each cell's event to `randT`

### Per-cell settings

|Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Trfm` | Determines the transform which is applied when this cell is active; special values are `@` (reset) and `*` (no transform)|
| `Offs` | Offset in semitones applied while this cell is active |
| `Inv` | Inversion of the transformed triad |
| `Muta` | Mutation event that is applied when the cell is left (i.e. on the next clock after the cell's transform is applied). Valid values are shown in the table below. Note that this setting makes the grid self-modifying as the current cell traverses it!|

|`Muta` setting | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| `none`        | nothing happens |
| `rT__`        | The transformation for this cell is set to a random value. |
| `r_O_`        | The transposition for this cell is set to a random value. |
| `rTO_`        | The transformation and the transposition for this cell is set to a random value. |
| `r__I`        | The inversion for this cell is set to a random value. |
| `r_OI`        | The transposition and the inversion for this cell is set to a random value. |
| `rTOI`        | The transformation, the transposition and the inversion for this cell is set to a random value. |


### Screensaver display

Similar to Harrington 1200 app, the current triad (output as pitch CVs on the B, C and D sockets) is shown graphically on a pitch circle on the left. On the right, the last few vector moves are shown as a "snake". The current output triad is also displayed.

### Tips

If you wish to use the vector sequencer to play melodies, then set the TRFM (transform) value for every cell in the grid to * (null transform), and set the `Offs` value for each cell to a specific note offset from the root note that you want to appear in your sequence. Then, as the current cell is moved around the grid by clock/trigger inputs on TR1, the note defined for that cell will be output on output B (with transpositions of the same note sequence on outputs C and D).
