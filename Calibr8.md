Calibr8 is a 2 channel pitch calibration tool to compensate for imperfect v/Oct tracking in your oscillators. For a 4 channel version with many more features (flexible quantization, sample and hold, auto-calibration), use the full [Calibr8or](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/wiki/Calibr8or) app.

| CV In          | Pitch CV input 1 |      Pitch CV input 2       |
| Output         |          Calibrated pitch CV 1           |           Calibrated pitch CV 2         |

Note: the outputs of Calibr8 are quantized to semitones
