### Harrington 1200

 - Provide an option which outputs the sum, or other linear combinations, of the pitch CVs for the current triad, on output A, instead of the pitch CV for the root note. No idea if that would be musically useful or not, but it can't hurt to try.

 - add Euclidean trigger/clock filters to the Harrington 1200, so that a single clock input can create a polyrhythmic pattern of triggers to drive the transformations.

 - work out to what use the CV2 and CV3 inputs might be put (maybe for the Euclidean trigger filter mentioned above?)

 - portamento for chord transitions, which may or may not be useful for chords (it is not traditional)
