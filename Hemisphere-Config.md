# Hemisphere Config
[Long-press DOWN button] to access.

### Presets
The first two options are Load and Save. Rotate either encoder to select, push to start. Press UP or DOWN buttons to cancel. Both applets (plus Clock Setup) with their state are recalled, along with the rest of the Config options on this page.

Presets only exist as settings in RAM. You still need to do an **[EEPROM Save](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/wiki/EEPROM-Save)** to make them persist!

### Trigger Length
This sets the pulse width for applets that generate simple triggers, such as **EuclidX** or **TrigSeq**. A value of 1 is shorter than ever, barely recognized by some modules, and much longer hold times are now possible. This is rather fun to play by hand.

### Cursor Edit Mode
The default cursor style is **modal** - rotate to move cursor, push to toggle editing, rotate to edit, push to toggle editing.

Here, you can select whether the cursor will **wrap** around or not when moving it, as well as the **Legacy** mode which behaves like original Hemisphere - push to advance, rotate to edit.

## Future

I want to stick a few more settings in here, on extra pages... which is menu-divey, unfortunately, but could be useful I think? Things like the 4 global Quantizer settings, maybe I/O routing, MIDI stuff.
