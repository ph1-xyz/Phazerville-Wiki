All of the Apps included in your firmware build have Config Settings that can change at runtime. You can make them persist after a power cycle with the built-in Ornament and Crime storage system:
* Return to the main menu by long-pressing the right encoder.
* Then, long-press the right encoder again.

This will save the state of all applications in the module.

As of v1.6.999, when storing a Preset within Hemispheres, settings are immediately written to EEPROM - no more need to manually do an EEPROM Save! Combined with Auto-save, this can result in frequent EEPROM writes... (only 100,000 write cycles are guaranteed, so use at your own risk!)
